# Stock_API_to_Excel


This program was created to solve a problem one of my clients had. He was copying and pasting financial data from Yahoo Finance into Excel and needed my help to speed up his workflow as his current method was costing him hours each week. 

I am pleased to say that after less than two weeks, I was able to write this program that is able to obtain the data needed via Tradier's Sandbox API and export it into an Excel spreadsheet along with a stock chart and other visualizations that my client requested. A task that used to take hours can now be accomplished in less than a minute. Furthermore, I wrote the program so that it can accommodate a variety of date ranges and stock symbols for easy customizability.
