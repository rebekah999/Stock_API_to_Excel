# Stock_API_to_Excel


This program was created to address a challenge faced by one of my clients. He used to manually copy and paste financial data from Yahoo Finance into Excel, seeking my assistance to streamline his workflow since his current method was consuming several hours each week.

I am pleased to announce that within less than two weeks, I developed a program capable of retrieving the necessary data through Tradier's Sandbox API and exporting it into an Excel spreadsheet. The program also generates a stock chart and other visualizations as per my client's request. A task that previously took hours can now be completed in less than a minute. Additionally, I designed the program to be adaptable to various date ranges and stock symbols, ensuring easy customization.
